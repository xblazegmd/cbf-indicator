# CBF Indicator
A simple mod that makes it very obvious when someone is using CBF

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod is **discontinued** due to the recent Geometry Dash update that added CBF as a vanilla feature (Click Between Steps, CBS), when this mod is made for the Geode CBF mod
> 
> This mod is only compatible with Geode 4.10.0, aka, Geometry Dash version 2.2074. 2.208 support won't be added for the above reasons. Instead, a new mod (similar to this one) will be made once Geode updates to support 2.208, that will be specifically for the RobTop CBS.

## Why?
While the CBF mod *does* leave a watermark when someone beats a level using CBF, it only appears on the endscreen, and it's quite easy to miss for most people.

The main advantage of this mod is that not only does it make it more clear on the endscreen (like how can you miss *that*), but it also has a live CBF indicator while playing the level.
