# CBF Indicator
A simple mod that makes it very obvious when someone is using CBF

## What this adds
- An indicator on the top left that appears when CBF is on
- An indicator on the level endscreen

## Why?
While the CBF mod *does* leave a watermark when someone beats a level using CBF, it only appears on the endscreen, and it's quite easy to miss for most people.

The main advantage of this mod is that not only does it make it more clear on the endscreen (like how can you miss *that*), but it also has a live CBF indicator while playing the level.
